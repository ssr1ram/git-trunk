# crypt

What if we could
    - encrypt a file, (using git-crypt maybe)
    - add it to a trunk store
    - share the key with others

What if we could then
    - delete the trunk store
    - wait for github to run 'git gc' 
    - now there would be no trace of the original store

Here is a grok conversation with some details
